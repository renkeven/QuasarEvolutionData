Compiled outputs from the semi-empirical model described in Ren+21  


One way to compute the QLF from LcMh is to use Eqn3 from Ren+21, with zc=4 and the parameters (Sigma, k) given in the manuscript.  
Alternatively, one can use the precomputed LcMh at different z (Eqn2).


Contains:

Lc(Mh) for 1 < z < 10 as shown in Fig1+2  
QLFs for 1 < z < 10 as shown in Fig1+2  
HMF for 1 < z < 10  
Halo Assembly Times, t(M) for 1 < z < 10 as computed using [Giocoli+07](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0611221)
