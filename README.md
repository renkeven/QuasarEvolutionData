Compiled outputs from the semi-empirical model described in Ren+21  


One way to compute the QLF from LcMh is to use Eqn3 from Ren+21, with zc=4.  
Alternatively, one can use LcMh at different z (Eqn2) for the same result.


Contains:

Lc(Mh) for 1 < z < 10 as shown in Fig1+2  
QLFs for 1 < z < 10 as shown in Fig1+2  
HMF for 1 < z < 10  
Halo Assembly Times, t(M) for 1 < z < 10 as computed using Giocoli+07
